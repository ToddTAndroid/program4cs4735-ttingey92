Description:

	I used the code given to us and built upon it. Enter the required info and press connect.
	Next a dialog will instruct you to press "A" once you are ready.
	After strapping on the VR headset press "A" (Or "B" in the case of my controller) to connect to the server and begin play.
	The "B" button (or on my controller the "A" button) will fire bullets. It fires in whichever direction you are looking. 
	Use the directional pad to move (forward, backward, left and right).
	The direction you move is relative to the direction you are facing (I.e. a forward press will always move you foward in the direction you are looking, etc.)
	Noops and scans have no input on the contoller, they are done passively (nothing is done with scan data in this version, but it does scan).

	Phone: Google Pixel, 5.0" (Nougat 7.1)
	Controller: Nintendo Switch Pro contoller

Anything that doesn't work:

	Everything should be working as expected.
